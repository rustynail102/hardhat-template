# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
** Compile
npx hardhat compile
** Test
npx hardhat test
** Deploy
npx hardhat run --network mumbai scripts/deploy.ts
** Verify
npx hardhat verify --newwork mumbai <address> <args>
```
